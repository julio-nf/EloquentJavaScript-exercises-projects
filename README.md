My own solutions and commentaries for the exercises of the book Eloquent JavaScript 3rd edition, Written by Marijn Haverbeke.

This book covers several subjects of JavaScript: from the story of the language to the initial steps and server-side JS with Node.
Its divided in three parts (Language, Browser and Node) and 21 chapters where 5 of them are chapter projects with large example programs.
All chapters (except from the first) has some exercises that we try to solve in this repository.

The writing is fantastic, the exercises are quite a challenge and there is much much information about programming and the language throughout the book, so I highly recommend this one.

The book is avalaible for free in https://eloquentjavascript.net/, but can also be bought in paper version.
